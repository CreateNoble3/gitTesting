# gitTesting
For testing purposes to verify git capabilities and workflow.

## Project Description
The main purpose of this repository is to test file uploading and project workflow using GitHub before entering a project. Initially this will mostly be used with Unreal projects, but eventually should include other projects as well.

### Progress
The first test is creating a test Unreal project and uploading it to GitHub to be accessed from another computer. After that a change will be made to the project, it will be reuploaded, and then downloaded on the inital computer to verify functionality in this method of use.
